# Fluid animations and interactions on iOS apps

This playground (works with Swift Playgrounds on iPad) was made to demonstrate some of the techniques I talked about in my "Fluid animations and interactions on iOS apps" talk at BA:Swiftable.

I also recommend reading [this excellent post by Christian Schnorr](https://medium.com/ios-os-x-development/demystifying-uikit-spring-animations-2bb868446773) to learn more about the math behind these techniques.

This [open-source sheet implementation](https://github.com/insidegui/sheet) can also be used to learn more about iOS interactions and animations.
